# Biography
I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). 

My research consolidates efforts in computer vision, medical physics, and medicine to develop surgeon-centric, end-to-end computer-assisted solutions for image-guided surgery. Currently, I am particularly interested in advancing interventional image processing to tailor image acquisition and augmented reality environments to the clinical task.
