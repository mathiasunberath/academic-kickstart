Machine learning-based approaches outperform competing methods in most disciplines relevant to diagnostic radiology. Interventional radiology, however, has not yet benefited substantially from the advent of deep learning, in particular because of two reasons: 1) Most images acquired during the procedure are never archived and are thus not available for learning, and 2) even if they were available, annotations would be a severe challenge due to the vast amounts of data. When considering fluoroscopy-guided procedures, an interesting alternative to true interventional fluoroscopy is *in silico* simulation of the procedure from 3D diagnostic CT. In this case, labeling is comparably easy and potentially readily available.
