I am very much looking forward to present our recent work on Augmented Reality and Machine Learning for image-guided procedures at this year's [Imaging Elevated Symposium of Emerging Investigators](https://medicine.utah.edu/imaging-elevated/) organized by the Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences at the University of Utah. Many thanks to [Frederic Noo](https://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/mddetail.php?facultyID=u0114767) for nominating me!
