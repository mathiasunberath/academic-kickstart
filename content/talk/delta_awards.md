The DELTA award is a very competitive funding mechanism (6 out of 64 proposals funded) that aims at enhancing the on- and off-campus learning experience. We will work with Drs. Tang and Ng, and Dr. Osgood to develop Augmented Reality systems that benefit the training of medical students, residents, and fellows."

#### Augmented Reality for Immersive 3-D Education in Complex Pelvic Trauma Surgery
The key challenge in treating unstable pelvic fractures, the proposal says, is that the doctors have to do mental mapping of plate positioning and screw trajectories to the fractured anatomy, a skill that surgeons-in-training cannot easily acquire from conventional two-dimensional materials. The grant will be used to create a three-dimensional learning environment that incorporates augmented reality.



#### Personalized Augmented Reality as an Interactive Teaching Tool for Facial Anatomy
Anatomy is one of the most challenging subject matters to both teach and learn, and facial anatomy is one of the most complex regions. This project proposes to design an augmented reality simulator that will help teach this especially challenging aspect of anatomy.
